### What I learned

Thanks to this tutorial I have learnt and practised the following DOM manipulation concepts:
- querySelector()
- getElementByID()
- addEventListener()
- innerHTML

And also other concepts like:
- setInterval() & clearInterval()
- toString()
- if statements

Would you like to know what the DOM is and what other concepts exist to manipulate and make cool and fun interactions? I have created 2 tutorials to explain and put in practise all concepts. Check them out:
